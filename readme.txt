I didn't implement the last two tasks (textures and cylinders).
Instead of showing cylinders, the "b" key rotates the view to a fixed position to make it a bit more practical.
From extra credits I implemented the game over screen and the blocks change their color after reaching the ground.
For shading, I tried to follow the lecture slides and looked it up online, and implement it that way, but specular highlights 
look a bit odd, so I am not quite sure I did that right. Some feedback on that would be appreciated.
I added the option to show the xyz axes, all of them (negative and positive) being of different color, just to make it easier
to know which way is which (can be toggled with "c" key).
I didn't bother implementing a score system, because it wasn't specified in the assignment.
As for ambient/diffuse/specular components, I made it so that the light has constant parameters for those (1) and you can only
change the parameters of the material (I hope this is ok).
